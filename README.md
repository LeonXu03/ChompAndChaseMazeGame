# Chomp and Chase Maze Game

This game was designed, implemented, and completed as a personal side project of mine. This is an homage to the game that inspired me to start learning software development. 

While PAC-MAN served as this project's source of inspiration, all gameplay elements and mechanics are original and uniquely designed by me.
